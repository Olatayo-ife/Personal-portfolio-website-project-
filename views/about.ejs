                    I am a frontend developer passionate about creating responsive, user-friendly web applications. My core skills include React, SASS, and modern frontend practices, and I am currently advancing into backend development with Node.js, Express, and related technologies. This transition allows me to grow into a well-rounded full-stack developer capable of building both dynamic user interfaces and robust server-side applications. With each project, I aim to sharpen my problem-solving skills and contribute to scalable, real-world solutions.
